#### International Collaborations

Active participant and invited member of the following:-   

**[Project MinE](https://www.projectmine.com/about/)**

Plan to map the full DNA profiles of at least 15,000 people with [ALS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis) and 7,500 control subjects, and to perform comparative analyses on the resulting data.  


**European Medical Information Framework:** WP3 integrative analysis task force and WP3/WP4 Genomics task force. URL: http://www.imi.europa.eu/content/emif  

The EMIF project aims to develop a common information framework of patient-level data that will link up and facilitate access to diverse medical and research data sources, opening up new avenues of research for scientists. To provide a focus and guidance for the development of the framework, the project will focus initially on questions relating to obesity and Alzheimer’s disease.

**The Genetic Architecture of Rate of Alzheimer’s Decline (GENAROAD) Consortium.** URL: http://www.genomes2people.org/genetic-architecture-of-rate-of-decline-in-alzheimers-disease/  

There is tremendous unexplained variability in the rate of Alzheimer’s disease progression that is not explained by clinical features or co-morbidities and is therefore, likely genetic. Understanding more about the genetic basis of this variability could help illuminate biological pathways involved in disease progression and could uncover clues to new therapies to slow disease progression. In addition, identifying genetic markers associated with more rapid or less rapid decline might also help refine the selection of subjects or inform the interpretation of future clinical trials. Investigators from several large studies are pooling longitudinal psychometric data and genotype data in order to discover new genes associated with rate of decline. These data have been collected or are being collected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium, the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Rush Religious Orders Study, Rush Memory and Ageing Study, the Cache County Study of Memory and Ageing, AddNeuroMed and several industry-sponsored pharmaceutical trials

#### London Containing Bioinformatics and Data Analytics
As a spin off from our Bio in Docker event, I have started a Meetup. 

[London Containing Bioinformatics & Data Analytics](http://www.meetup.com/London-Containing-Bioinformatics-Data-Analytics-Meetup/)  

A group for all those coders and open source champions. Git lovers, Docker enthusiasts, applied Bio-/Health-/Medical-Informaticians and Machine Learners. ELK stack fans, software devs and engineers and UX/UI designers. For all those general computer and data science folks that are interested in meeting like-minded practitioners to chat/rant and play; set some standards, and hopefully, start and do some interesting things with real world applications.
